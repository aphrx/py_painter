# PyPainter

## Execution
Make sure you have Python3 installed on your machine and a Windows PC with paint. This can work with other drawing apps but will probably need a bit more modification.

This script should work out of the box for a machine with a resolution of 1920x1080 given that paint is fullscreen. Otherwise, there are certain coordinates marked in the script that will need to be changed. Commenting out the while loop in the __main__ function should help you determine the coordinates. Make sure the pen tool is already selected in paint prior to execution.

To execute the project, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python script.py
```
